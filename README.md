# tm-twitch-map-command
A simple Trackmania command for setting a !map in the twitch chat.

I used https://openplanet.nl/files/22 for this project.

The idea is to be able to easily set a "!map" command on a twitch chat using Nightbot.

# Install

- Install Openplanet: https://openplanet.nl/tutorials/installation
- Copy the files to C:/Users/[Username]/Openplanet4/Scripts/
- Go to https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ .
- Copy the text you get.
- Edit `TwitchSettings.as` and change the Setting_TwitchToken variable with what you just got.
- Change also the TwitchNickname and the TwitchChannel variables.

# Usage

Beware, if you're not on a map, nothing will happen ! :)

- Run Maniaplanet
- Open Openplanet toolbar
- Click on Scripts > Twitch > !map command
