# tm-twitch-map-command
A simple Trackmania command for setting a !map in the twitch chat.

I used https://openplanet.nl/files/22 for this project.

The idea is to be able to easily set a "!map" command on a twitch chat using Nightbot.

# Install

- Install Openplanet: https://openplanet.nl/tutorials/installation
- Copy the files to C:/Users/[Username]/Openplanet4/Scripts/
- Open Maniaplanet
- Open Openplanet toolbar (F3 default)
- Click on Openplanet > Settings > Twitch commands
- Go to https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ .
- Paste the text you get in the field `Twitch Token`.
- Set the `Twitch channel` field.
- Reload the script using Scripts > Reload scripts.
- Tweak other settings if you want.

# Usage

Beware, if you're not on a map, nothing will happen ! :)

- Run Maniaplanet
- Open Openplanet toolbar
- Click on Scripts > Twitch > Manually update command
==> Done

If you enabled the `Auto update` setting in Openplanet > Settings > Twitch commands, you don't need to click on the `Manually update command` button.

You can call the command in your chat from the game using: Scripts > Twitch > Call command in chat.
